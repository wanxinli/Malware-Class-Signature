The first part of this Readme modifies the work done by the first part of the project.
So the Feature ranking modified code is expected to work for any dataset. 
So you open the final.py and run it. You must pass three paramaters at run time in this order:
1. the input dataset 2. the target dataset  3. the feature names 
All the three runtime parameters must be in text file format.
So you simply go to the command line interface of your windows or linux system, and type the following:
final.py input_dataset.txt 01_label.txt feature_names.txt
The program will display the GUI showing a list of algorithms you can use to train your dataset to produce feature ranking scores.
The best options from the list are Linear Regression and Correlation algorithm but you can still try the rest and see the results.
Either of those two will produce a sorted list of feature rankings of all the features of the dataset. You copy this into a text file. I already did that for all the 66 labels so i have 66 score files. 

Now for the second part of the project which takes the top ten features.
You run the top_ten script and pass the name of the score file as the single runtime argument.
This is generate a bar graph that will show the top ten best features together with their scores.
Again you can generate 66 bar graphs for each of the 66 score files. 

Note: Recall that in the presentation few days ago, John pointed out a bug in my code that I have fixed.
The problem was that I used the malware ID as a feature in my code. I have fixed that bug. I have removed it from my list of features and replaced it with a genuine feature.
Unfortunately I did not change the affected graphs because it is a very tedious process gathering all of it. And I have very little time before the deadline plus my exams. The affected graphs are not that much.
