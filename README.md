# Malware Class Signature Project 1 & 2: 

We divide project into 5 parts: 
1. Filter: Zicheng Liu & Wanxin Li
2. Cluster: Zicheng Liu & Wanxin Li
3. T-SNE: Abdulrahman Alshammari
4. Feature Ranking: Ezeanaka Kingsley
5. Roc Curve & Confusion Matrix: Zicheng Liu & Wanxin Li 

The scripts of these three parts are saved into separate folders under "spring-2017-CISC850-visual-analytics-1/script" path. And there is a README instruction for each part. Please read them to know how to run each part: )

For the future work, we consider on combining the scripts into a software that is with good interactive interface and adaptive functionality. That means given any dataset with feature vectors, predictions, and classes this software should be able to working.
