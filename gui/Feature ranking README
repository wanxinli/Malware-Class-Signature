Alright this is the READme file for running the feature ranking GUI. Kindly read carefully.

The GUI takes a pair of datasets as inputs the first input is the raw dataset with as many features and any of the label or target dataset containing the clusters of output. The user is prompted to choose any of the listed algorithms with which to train the dataset. Choosing any of the algorithm buttons activates the corresponding algorithm, subsequently trains the dataset and produces the list of importance values sorted in descending order with the important feature ranking at the top of the list.



Before running the final.py file in your AWS clean instance, make sure you have the input dataset and target datasets in separate .txt file format and place them in the same directory as the script file. Make sure you are using the latest version of pip installed after which  you install the pyqt5 library. Make sure you have installed the following libraries numpy, scipy , sci-kit on your clean AWS instance. These can be achieved with the following commands: 
pip3 install pyqt5
pip3 install sklearn
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install minepy
Now when you are ready to run the script, you type the name of the script, in this case, final.py and the name of the dataset files to pass as parameters for the script.

the input dataset is the text file
